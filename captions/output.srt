00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A Data Scientist is a person who uses data to solve problems, uncover patterns and gain

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
insight.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,200
They often work in businesses and organizations which gather and curate large datasets.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,520
A Data Scientist may leverage knowledge from statistics, computer programming, databases,

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,360
machine learning and mathematical modeling to achieve their goals.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,800
A day in the life of a Data Scientist.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,400
First, the Data Scientist needs to understand the business or organizational issues.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,120
Then they look for data.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,720
They may need to set up an experiment to acquire the data or the data may already exist somewhere

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
in.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,520
If an experiment is required, it is important to write down the hypothesis before proceeding.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,800
Once the data is gathered, it is checked and cleaned.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Then, the right tools for modeling are chosen.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,600
For example, R, Python or another software package.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,480
The data and results are then analyzed using visualization tools.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,120
The Data Scientist is looking for important insights and trends and checking their hypothesis.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Statistical tests are used to check the results robust and valid.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,880
The learnings, results and insights are communicated to the stakeholders, usually with recommendations.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,440
For example, a Data Scientist working for a transport company might identify particular

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,000
routes that are inefficient and recommend solutions to them more efficient.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
With the advent of the Data Age, we can all now, with the help of Data Scientist, give

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,600
better insights and make better data driven decisions.
